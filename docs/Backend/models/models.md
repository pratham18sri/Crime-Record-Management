## Description

This project defines data models for users and crimes, likely for an application tracking or analyzing crime-related data.

## How to Use

The project provides data models. Usage depends on the specific framework or application context where these models are employed. Requires Node.js and a compatible database.

## Technologies Used

*   JavaScript
*   Node.js (likely)
*   Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL - implementation specific)

## Architecture or Code Overview

The project consists of two core model files:

*   `crime.model.js`: Defines the structure and properties of crime data (details in file).
*   `user.model.js`: Defines the structure and properties of user data (details in file).

The models are likely used within a Node.js application.

## Known Issues / Improvements

*   Requires detailed documentation within each model file (`crime.model.js` and `user.model.js`) regarding the model fields, data types, and potential relationships with other data.
*   The project lacks usage examples or integration details.
*   Needs a clear description for data relationships between user and crime models.

## Additional Notes or References

*   See the individual model files (`crime.model.js` and `user.model.js`) for their specific attributes and implementation details.
