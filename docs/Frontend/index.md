## Description

This project is a Crime Record Management System. It's built as a web application, indicated by the `index.html` file and references to React components via the `main.jsx` script.

## How to Use

1.  **Installation:** The specific installation steps are not available from the `index.html` file. It's implied this is a React application using Vite as a build tool, so you may need to install node packages and run `npm install` and `npm run dev` or `npm start`
2.  **Usage:** Access the application through your web browser after starting the development server. The main application logic will be loaded from `/src/main.jsx`.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   JavaScript (likely React, given the file extension `.jsx`)
*   Vite (implied, from `/vite.svg`)

## Architecture or Code Overview

The `index.html` file serves as the entry point for the web application. It includes:

*   Metadata including the title "Crime-Record-Management-System"
*   A root element `<div id="root"></div>` where the React application will be rendered.
*   A script tag that imports `/src/main.jsx`, the likely entry point for the React application.

## Known Issues / Improvements

*   The project description is limited.
*   Further details about the components, data flow, and database are unavailable in the provided `index.html` file.

## Additional Notes or References

The project leverages React (implied by `.jsx` extension) and likely uses Vite. More details can be found in the `/src/main.jsx` file.
