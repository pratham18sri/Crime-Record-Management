## Description

This project is the entry point for a Crime Record Management System. It serves as the foundation for a React application, setting up the necessary HTML structure and importing the main JavaScript file (`main.jsx`).

## How to Use

1.  **Installation:**

    This project uses Vite and React. Ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm installed.

    Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Running the Application:**

    Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   React
*   Vite
*   JavaScript (JSX)

## Architecture or Code Overview

The `index.html` file sets up the basic HTML structure, including the `<head>` and `<body>` elements. It includes a `<div id="root"></div>` element, which is where the React application will be rendered. The `<script>` tag imports `src/main.jsx`, the entry point for the React application.

## Known Issues / Improvements

*   No specific issues or improvements are identified within this `index.html` file. Further development will take place in `src/main.jsx` and other files within the `src` directory.

## Additional Notes or References

This `index.html` file serves as the entry point for a larger React application. Future development should focus on the functionality of the React components in the `src` directory.
