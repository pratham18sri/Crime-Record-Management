## Description

This project provides React components for user authentication, specifically login and signup functionalities.

## How to Use

To use these components in your React application:

1.  **Install React:**  If you don't already have it, set up a React project.
2.  **Import Components:** Import `Login.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx` into your desired components.
3.  **Implement Logic:**  Integrate the components into your authentication flow, handling user input, API calls, and state management.

## Technologies Used

*   React
*   JavaScript (ES6+)

## Architecture or Code Overview

The project comprises two main React components:

*   `Login.jsx`:  Handles user login via a form, potentially making API calls to authenticate users.
*   `SignUp.jsx`: Manages user registration, likely including form validation and API calls to create new user accounts.

## Known Issues / Improvements

*   **No specific implementation details are provided in current files**: This README is generic and needs to be updated with implementation specifics once the components are available.

## Additional Notes or References

*   This project is intended as a base for authentication components and requires integration with backend services or databases.
